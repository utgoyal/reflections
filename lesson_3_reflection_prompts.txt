When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want other people to contribute to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there can be more than one person working on the same branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is just like a clone that is done directly on github, it gives credit to the creator of the repository
A clone is a copy of the repository present on github to your computer
branches are different paths through commits that your code can take, these can be labeled merged and a lot more can be done with them. Basically branches are a path of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It would let us know whether someone who is contributing to the git repo online has made
a change to the repository and whether it is conflicting with the changes that we have
made .

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be almost impossible to collaborate without Git or Github, we would have to make separate files 
for different time stamps and check with the FC command for what changes have been made to the original file
this would mean maintaining a large number of files to keep track of the progress. The easier way would be
using Git and Github.
