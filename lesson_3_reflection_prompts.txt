When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want other people to contribute to my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because there can be more than one person working on the same branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is just like a clone that is done directly on github, it gives credit to the creator of the repository
A clone is a copy of the repository present on github to your computer
branches are different paths through commits that your code can take, these can be labeled merged and a lot more can be done with them. Basically branches are a path of commits.
